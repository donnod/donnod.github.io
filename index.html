    <h1>SGXPECTRE</h1>
      <p>SGXPECTRE Attacks exploit the recently disclosed CPU bugs to subvert the confidentiality of SGX enclaves. When branch prediction of the enclave code can be influenced by programs outside the enclave, the control flow of the enclave program can be temporarily altered to execute instructions that lead to observable cache-state changes. An adversary observing such changes can learn secrets inside the enclave memory or its internal registers, thus completely defeating the confidentiality guarantee offered by SGX. Any enclave program could be vulnerable to SGXPECTRE Attacks since the desired code patterns are available in most SGX runtimes (e.g., Intel SGX SDK, Rust-SGX, and Graphene-SGX).
